# CastleVsEnemiesSimulation

## My first project in college using *Procedural Programming Paradigm* with *C++*

## It's a simulation game between Castle towers and enemies

### To know how the program works you can read the [Requirements](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CastleVsEnemiesSimulation/tree/master/Project%20Requirements.pdf) file

### You can run this game by opening [Project.sln](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CastleVsEnemiesSimulation/tree/master/Project.sln) in Visual Studio

#### There are available test cases that used while testing the project in [TestCases](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CastleVsEnemiesSimulation/tree/master/Test%20Cases) folder

#### To use these test cases you can move any file from [Input](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CastleVsEnemiesSimulation/tree/master/Test%20Cases/Input) directory to the [Project_Data](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CastleVsEnemiesSimulation/tree/master/Project_Data) directory then type the name of that file while executing the program and the output generated in [Project_Data](Project_Data) directory should match with the one corresponding to that input file in [Output](https://github.com/OmarKimo/CastleVsEnemiesSimulation/tree/master/Test%20Cases/Output) directory `e.g. input 11.txt & output 11.txt`
